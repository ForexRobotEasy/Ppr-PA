# Ppr PA - PPR Pattern Recognition Indicator

Ppr PA is a custom indicator for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that recognizes PPR (Price Pattern Recognition) patterns on the chart and generates buy and sell signals based on these patterns. PPR patterns are identified by comparing the current PPR value with the previous PPR value.

## Indicator Parameters

- **period**: The period used for calculating the PPR value (default: 14)
- **buyColor**: The color used for buy signals (default: Green)
- **sellColor**: The color used for sell signals (default: Red)

## How It Works

The Ppr PA indicator calculates the PPR value for each bar on the chart. The PPR value is calculated by subtracting the low price from the high price of the bar. The PPR values are stored in the `pprBuffer` array.

To generate signals, the indicator checks for PPR patterns by comparing the current PPR value with the previous PPR value. If the current PPR value is greater than the previous PPR value, it is considered a PPR pattern.

When a PPR pattern is detected, the indicator generates a buy signal if the current PPR value is lower than the previous PPR value, and a sell signal if the current PPR value is higher than the previous PPR value. The signals are marked on the chart with arrows and text, using the specified colors.

## Usage

To use the Ppr PA indicator, follow these steps:

1. Install the indicator in your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Open the desired chart and attach the Ppr PA indicator to it.
3. Adjust the indicator parameters if necessary.
4. The indicator will automatically calculate the PPR values and generate buy and sell signals based on PPR patterns.
5. Pay attention to the signals and consider them as potential entry or exit points for your trades.
